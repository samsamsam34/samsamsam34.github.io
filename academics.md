Over the past three years, I have taken a variety of MSU courses in hydrology, geology, environmental science, soil science, remote sensing, spatial analysis, and computer science, in which I also have a minor. Through these classes, I have gained skills in Python, Java, GIS, R, html/css, ERDAS Imagine, and advanced GPS technology (data collection and postprocessing), among other similar skills. I have also developed a foundation in ecology, biology, hydrology, and earth and soil science. I have also completed a number of large-scale projects including spatial and temporal explorations of the trends in fire activity and of seasonal snow retreat in north central Washington State, a project using remote sensing to derive glacial mass balance in Greenland, and projects examining soil and water properties in Bozeman. These projects can be seen [here](projects.md){: .btn}. In completing these projects and other classwork, I have primarily focused on the detection of environmental status and trends, especially those caused by climate change. 

While my primary focus has been on environmental and physical science, geospatial analysis, and computer science, I am pursuing an Honors College degree and have taken a wide variety of interdisciplinary honors courses. These classes have greatly broadened my worldview and helped me build communication skills.
