UPDATE: I am interested in tackling issues in environmental science, vegetation, geology, hydrology and snow science through the use of a variety of spatial and statistical analysis techniques. As a Junior at Montana State University, I have skills in remote sensing, structure from motion, GIS, computer science and statistics as well as an understanding of topics in environmental science, soils, geology, and watershed hydrology. I am also participating in ongoing research in a geospatially based snow hydrology lab and would like to continue participating in active research in the future.
