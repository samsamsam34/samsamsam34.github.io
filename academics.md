Over the past three years, I have taken a variety of MSU courses in remote sensing, spatial analysis, environmental science, and computer science. Through these classes, I have gained skills in Python, Java, GIS, R, html/css, ERDAS Imagine, and advanced GPS technology, among other similar skills. I have also developed a solid foundation in ecology, biology, hydrology, and earth and soil science. I have also completed a number of large-scale projects including spatial and temporal explorations of the trends in fire activity and of seasonal snow retreat in north central Washington State, a project using remote sensing to derive glacial mass balance in Greenland, and projects examining soil and water properties in Bozeman. These projects can be seen [here](projects.md){: .btn}. In completing these projects and other classwork, I have primarily focused on the detection of environmental status and trends, especially those caused by climate change. 

While my primary focus has been on environmental science, geospatial analysis, and computer science, I have also taken a wide variety of interdisciplinary honors courses such as Chinese and literature based seminars. These classes have greatly broadened my worldview and sharpened my communication skills.
