title: "About Me"
---


I am interested in studying topics including environmental science, vegetation, geology, hydrology, and snow science through the use of a variety of spatial and statistical analysis techniques. As a Junior at Montana State University, I have skills in remote sensing, structure from motion, GIS, computer science and statistics as well as an understanding of the physical and environmental sciences. I am also participating in ongoing research in a geospatial snow hydrology lab and will be interning at NASA JPL this summer and using UAVSAR to measure snowpack. 

In my free time, I love to get outside, and enjoy a wide range of activities from tossing a frisbee in the park with friends to skinning up a couloir. Here’s me on the second day of a 10 day backpacking trip in the Sierra Nevada.

I also spend a lot of time practicing and playing music, and enjoy jamming with friends and playing shows. Here’s a picture of a guitar I built out of a beautiful slab of silver maple, and have used in several gigs!
