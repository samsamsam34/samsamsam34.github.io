Throughout my college career, I have completed a number of large scale projects that have helped me to learn new concepts and skills. Below is a subset of GIS and remote sensing-based projects that I have completed and that I am particularly proud of. These projects are sorted chronologically which makes it easy to see my progression as a scientist and geospatial analyst over time.
